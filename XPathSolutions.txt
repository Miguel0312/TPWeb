First part
Step 1: Exploring the instance [XPath]

1. the official names of the countries:
/countries/country/country_name/offic_name

2. the latitude of each country
/countries/country/coordinates/@lat

3. the area of each country
/countries/country/@area

4. the official names of European countries
/countries/country[infosContinent/continent = "Europe"]/country_name/offic_name

5. the common names of countries that do not have any native name
/countries/country/country_name[count(native_name) = 0]/common_name

6. the official names of the countries expressed in French, for those who have such names
/countries/country/country_name/native_name[@lang="fra"]/offic_name

7. elements with at least one attribute
//.[count(@*)>0]

8. official names of the second native name of countries (for those who have)
/countries/country/country_name/native_name[position()=2]/offic_name

9. the sum of the surfaces of the countries of Africa
sum(/countries/country[infosContinent/continent = "Africa"]/@area)

10. countries whose common name is not contained in their official name
/countries/country/country_name[not(contains(offic_name, common_name))]/offic_name

11. France's last neighbor
/countries/country[country_name/common_name="France"]/borders/neighbour[last()]

12. the position of France in the XML document
count(/countries/country[country_name/common_name="France"]/preceding-sibling::*)+1


Step 2: Instance update [XML, DTD]

there are 4 types of declared occurrence for child nodes:
exaclty one occurrence:
<!ELEMENT example-elem (example)>

zero or more occurrence:
<!ELEMENT example-elem (example*)>

zero or one occurrence:
<!ELEMENT example-elem (example?)>

one or more occurrence:
<!ELEMENT example-elem (example+)>


for each child mark with the * declared occurrence we have to verify that it is the most appropriate type
if not we need to change to the type that is the most appropriate

the definition of country before we modify it is:
<!ELEMENT country (country_name,tld*,country_codes,currency*,callingCode*,
                   capital,altSpellings*, infosContinent*,languages*,
                   coordinates*,demonym,landlocked,borders*)>

the children we need to verify are: tld, currency, callingCode, altSpellings, infosContinent, languages, coordinates and borders


In order to decide which of these type to chose we have to test 2 things on these children of country
if there is any country that does not have this type of child
/countries/country[count(tld)=0]

if there is any country that has multiple child of this type
/countries/country[count(tld)>1]

after running these tests and modify the definition of country accordingly it is:
<!ELEMENT country (country_name,tld*,country_codes,currency*,callingCode*,
                   capital,altSpellings+, infosContinent,languages,
                   coordinates?,demonym,landlocked,borders?)>
